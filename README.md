# Mac Terminal Style Config
This repository contains files that are used to configure the style and look of the mac terminal: vim syntax highlighting, terminal syntax highlighting, terminal profile, etc.
These are configurations/styles that I use on my own Mac.
If you wish to override the current vim (read more about in 'better vim') and have the `bash_profile` set up automatically, execute `automatic setup.sh` via finder or terminal.
