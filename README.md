This repository contains files that are used to configure the style and look of the mac terminal: vim syntax highlighting, terminal syntax highlighting, terminal profile, etc.
These are configurations/styles that I use on my own Mac.
If you wish to have everything set up automatically, execute `automatic setup.sh`. 

# Notes
## Automatic Setup Notes
The automatic setup script is somewhat of a work in progress. The main part that needs to be worked on is the functions that are used to catch an error that can occure due to xcode being install first and the terms and conditions not being accepted, before the command line tools are installed. Considering this, the script should run perfectly as long as you don't do what was mentioned in the previous sentence.
