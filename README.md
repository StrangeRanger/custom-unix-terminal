# Mac Terminal Style Config
This repository contains files that are used to configure the style and look of the mac terminal: vim syntax highlighting, terminal syntax highlighting, terminal profile, etc.
These are configurations/styles that I use on my own Mac.
If you wish to have "most" of the stuff set up automatically, execute `automatic setup.sh` via finder or terminal.
At the moment, `automatic setup.sh` only takes care of setting up the vimrc and bash_profile. You must set up the other stuff manually.
