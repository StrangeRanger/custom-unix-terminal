# Mac Terminal Style Config
[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

This repository contains files that are used to configure the style, look, and functionality of the mac terminal:

* Vim syntax highlighting
* Terminal syntax highlighting
* Terminal profile
* Etc.

These are configurations/styles that I personally use on my own Mac, so don't expect there to be many options in terms of configurations and styles.

## Automatic Setup

I have created an automatic setup script that can be used to easily set everything up. The script will provide you with options on what you'd like to install/setup. Upon executing the script, you will see something similar to the text below:

```txt
